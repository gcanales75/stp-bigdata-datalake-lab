The IT team at UnicornNation has exported Merchandise Sales data from their finance system and transferred this data to a folder in a single S3 bucket. There are multiple .CSV files in the bucket, each representing a monthâ€™s worth of data.
In this lab, we are going to create a Glue Data Crawler to crawl across this bucket. Once we have created the crawler, we are going to run it to determine the tables that are located in the bucket and add their definitions to the Glue Data Catalog.

To create your Glue data crawler, follow these steps: 

1. Login to the AWS Console using the login URL and credentials provided. Once you are logged in, check in the upper right-hand corner that you are using **Oregon** region. If not, use the drop-down list to change to the **Oregon** region.
